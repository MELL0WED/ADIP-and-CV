Here, we have to read an image and enhance the contrast such that only the achromatic part changes and the colour vector is preserved.
We performed the follwing operations in the code:-

1. The algorithm converts the color space of the input image from BGR to HSV(Hue, Saturation, Value) using the 
BGR_HSV_CONVERSION function.

2. The algorithm then checks the saturation of each pixel in the image in the contrast_enhancement function. If the saturation is less than 0.1 (indicating an achromatic or near grayscale pixel), it enhances the contrast of that pixel by multiplying the Value component by 1.3

3. After enhancing the contrast, the algorithm the HSV image back to BRG using th HSV_BGR_CONVERSION function

4 Finally, the algorithm saves the image and displays the enhanced image using Matplotlib.

5. For the output, we can see in the Image that the contrast of only the achromatic part changes and rest remains same preserving the colour vector.
